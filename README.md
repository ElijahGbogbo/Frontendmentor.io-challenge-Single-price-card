# Frontendmentor.io-challenge-Single-price-card
This is my solution to the single price card frontend challenge on (frontendmentor.io). 
It is a single-page website that displays price to join a community of developers where you will have access to a number of useful resources relevant to software development. It contains a sign up button that enables you create an account which is the first step before you get to make the payment.
